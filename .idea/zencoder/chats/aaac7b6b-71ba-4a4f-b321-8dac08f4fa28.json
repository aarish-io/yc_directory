Modified the image styling:\n   - Changed `object-cover` to `object-contain` to ensure the image fits within its container without being cropped\n   - Added `max-h-[65vh]` to limit the image height to 65% of the viewport height (slightly smaller than the section to ensure proper padding)\n   - Kept the `w-full` to maintain responsiveness, but now with the height constraint\n\nThese changes will prevent the need for scrolling while still displaying the image properly. The image will now be contained within the viewport, and its proportions will be maintained thanks to the `object-contain` property.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to adjust about this solution?"

                    "text": "I'll explain all these concepts from scratch:\n\n## Markdown in Your Code\n\n### What is Markdown?\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted content using plain text. It's designed to be easy to write and read, with simple syntax for creating headings, lists, links, emphasis, and more.\n\nFor example, in Markdown:\n- `# Heading` creates a heading\n- `**bold text**` creates bold text\n- `- item` creates a list item\n\n### How It's Used in Your Code\n\nIn your code, you're using a library called `markdown-it` to convert Markdown text to HTML:\n\n```javascript\nimport markdownit from \"markdown-it\";\nconst md = new markdownit();\n```\n\nThis creates a markdown parser that can transform Markdown text into HTML. Then, you use it here:\n\n```javascript\nconst parsedContent = md.render(post?.pitch || '');\n```\n\nThis line takes the `pitch` field from your `post` object (which contains Markdown text) and converts it to HTML. If `post.pitch` doesn't exist, it uses an empty string as a fallback.\n\n### Where Markdown is Used in Your Application\n\nBased on your code, you're using Markdown for the \"pitch details\" section of startup profiles. This allows users to write formatted content (like headings, lists, links, etc.) in a simple text format, which you then render as properly formatted HTML.\n\n## dangerouslySetInnerHTML\n\n### What is dangerouslySetInnerHTML?\n\n`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is a React attribute that allows you to insert HTML directly into a component. It's called \"dangerous\" because it can expose your application to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if you're not careful about sanitizing the HTML.\n\n### How You're Using It\n\n```javascript\n<article dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html:parsedContent}}/>\n```\n\nThis line takes the HTML that was generated from the Markdown (stored in `parsedContent`) and inserts it directly into the DOM. The `__html` property is required when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.\n\nIn your case, it's relatively safe because:\n1. You're using `markdown-it` which sanitizes the HTML by default\n2. The content is coming from your Sanity CMS, not directly from users\n\n## The Article Tag\n\n### What is the Article Tag?\n\nThe `<article>` tag is an HTML5 semantic element that represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site. It's meant for content that could stand independently and would make sense on its own, even if everything else on the page was removed.\n\n### In Simple Words\n\nThink of an `<article>` tag like a newspaper article or a blog post. It's a complete piece of content that makes sense by itself. In your application, you're using it to wrap the pitch details of a startup, which is appropriate because that content is a standalone piece of information about the startup.\n\n### How You're Using It\n\n```javascript\n<article dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html:parsedContent}}/>\n```\n\nYou're using the `<article>` tag to wrap the HTML content that was generated from the Markdown. This tells browsers and screen readers that this content is a complete, self-contained piece of information.\n\n## Summary of the Flow\n\n1. You store startup pitch details as Markdown text in your Sanity CMS\n2. When displaying a startup, you fetch this Markdown text\n3. You convert the Markdown to HTML using `markdown-it`\n4. You insert this HTML into an `<article>` tag using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`\n5. This displays the formatted pitch details to the user\n\nThis approach gives you the best of both worlds: easy content creation with Markdown and rich, formatted display with HTML."

It's essentially the core message that explains:\n\n1. What the startup does\n2. What problem it solves\n3. Why it's valuable or innovative\n4. How it works or plans to succeed\n\nThe pitch is stored in your Sanity CMS as a Markdown field, which allows for rich formatting while being easy to write.\n\n## How the Pitch is Used in Your Application\n\nLooking at your code, the pitch is:\n- Stored in the `pitch` field of your startup documents in Sanity\n- Retrieved when viewing a specific startup's page\n- Converted from Markdown to HTML\n- Displayed in the \"Pitch details\" section of your startup page\n\n## How to Add a Pitch to Your Startups\n\nTo add a pitch to your startups, you'll need to:\n\n1. **Access your Sanity Studio**: This is where you manage your content\n\n2. **Edit a startup document**: Find the startup you want to add a pitch to\n\n3. **Find the pitch field**: Look for a field labeled \"Pitch\" or similar\n\n4. **Write your pitch using Markdown**: You can use Markdown formatting to make your pitch more readable and engaging\n\n### Example of a Good Startup Pitch (in Markdown)\n\n```markdown\n## Our Mission\n\nAt [Startup Name], we're solving [specific problem] for [target audience].\n\n### The Problem\n\n[Describe the problem in detail, using statistics if possible]\n\n### Our Solution\n\n[Explain your product/service and how it solves the problem]\n\n### Why We're Different\n\n- **Unique Feature 1**: Description\n- **Unique Feature 2**: Description\n- **Unique Feature 3**: Description\n\n### Market Opportunity\n\n[Describe the market size and growth potential]\n\n### Current Traction\n\n- [Milestone 1]\n- [Milestone 2]\n- [Milestone 3]\n\n### Next Steps\n\n[Outline your roadmap or what you're looking for]\n```\n\n## If You Can't Find the Pitch Field in Sanity\n\nIf you don't see a pitch field in your Sanity Studio, you might need to:\n\n1. Check if your schema has a pitch field defined\n2. Update your schema to include a pitch field\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to help you check your Sanity schema to ensure the pitch field is properly set up.\n\n## Tips for Writing Effective Startup Pitches\n\n1. **Be concise**: Get to the point quickly\n2. **Focus on the problem**: Clearly articulate the problem you're solving\n3. **Highlight your unique value**: Explain what makes your solution special\n4. **Use data**: Include relevant statistics or metrics\n5. **Tell a story**: Make your pitch engaging and memorable\n6. **Use formatting**: Leverage Markdown to organize your content with headings, lists, and emphasis\n7. **Include a call to action**: What do you want readers to do next?\n\nWould you like me to help you craft a specific pitch for one of your startups, or would you like to see how to add or modify the pitch field in your Sanity schema?"

Here's what was missing:\n\n## The Missing Pitch Field\n\nYour implementation was trying to use a `pitch` field that wasn't defined in your schema. I've added the missing field to your schema:\n\n```typescript\ndefineField({\n    name:'pitch',\n    title: 'Pitch Details',\n    type: 'markdown',\n    description: 'Write the detailed pitch for your startup using Markdown formatting'\n}),\n```\n\nThis field is what your tutor was using to store the Markdown content for startup pitches.\n\n## How the Pitch System Works\n\nNow that the field is added, here's how the complete pitch system works:\n\n1. **Schema Definition**: The `pitch` field is defined in your Sanity schema as a Markdown field\n   - This allows content creators to write formatted text using Markdown syntax\n\n2. **Data Storage**: When someone creates or edits a startup in Sanity Studio, they can add pitch details in Markdown format\n   - Example: They might write `## Our Mission` for a heading and `* Feature 1` for bullet points\n\n3. **Data Retrieval**: Your `STARTUP_BY_ID_QUERY` fetches this Markdown content along with other startup details\n\n4. **Markdown Processing**: In your page component, you use `markdown-it` to convert this Markdown to HTML:\n   ```javascript\n   const parsedContent = md.render(post?.pitch || '');\n   ```\n\n5. **Rendering**: You then use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render this HTML content:\n   ```javascript\n   <article dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html:parsedContent}}/>\n   ```\n\n## How to Add a Pitch to Your Startups\n\nNow that the field is properly defined, you can add pitches to your startups in Sanity Studio:\n\n1. Go to your Sanity Studio\n2. Edit a startup\n3. You should now see a \"Pitch Details\" field\n4. Write your pitch using Markdown formatting\n5. Save the changes\n\nYour pitch will now appear in the \"Pitch details\" section of your startup page, properly formatted according to your Markdown.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to explain about the pitch functionality?"

                    "text": "Perfect! Now I have all the information I need to explain the `prose` class in Tailwind CSS.\n\n## The `prose` Class in Tailwind CSS\n\nThe `prose` class is part of the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin, which I can see you have installed in your project (line 41 in package.json). This plugin is specifically designed to style content that comes from rich text editors, markdown, or other sources where you don't have direct control over the HTML.\n\n### What `prose` Does\n\nThe `prose` class applies a set of sensible typography styles to your content, including:\n\n1. **Proper spacing** between elements like paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.\n2. **Appropriate font sizes** for different heading levels\n3. **Consistent styling** for lists, blockquotes, code blocks, and other elements\n4. **Responsive adjustments** for different screen sizes\n\n### How to Use It\n\nBased on the context in your original file, you were using it like this:\n\n```jsx\n<article\n  className=\"prose max-w-4xl font-work-sans break-all\"\n  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: parsedContent }}\n/>\n```\n\nThis is the perfect use case for `prose` - you're taking Markdown content, converting it to HTML, and then displaying it. The `prose` class ensures that all the HTML elements generated from your Markdown are properly styled.\n\n### Customizing `prose`\n\nYou can customize the `prose` class with additional modifiers:\n\n1. **Size variants**: `prose-sm`, `prose-lg`, `prose-xl`, `prose-2xl`\n2. **Color themes**: `prose-gray`, `prose-blue`, etc.\n3. **Width constraints**: You're already using `max-w-4xl` which is good\n\n### Suggested Implementation\n\nFor your startup pitch display, I recommend using:\n\n```jsx\n<article\n  className=\"prose prose-lg max-w-4xl font-work-sans\"\n  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: parsedContent }}\n/>\n```\n\nI've made a few changes:\n1. Added `prose-lg` to increase the font size slightly for better readability\n2. Removed `break-all` which can make text hard to read (it breaks words at any character)\n   - Consider using `break-words` instead if you're concerned about overflow\n\nIf you want to customize the colors to match your brand:\n\n```jsx\n<article\n  className=\"prose prose-lg max-w-4xl font-work-sans prose-headings:text-primary-default prose-a:text-primary-default\"\n  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: parsedContent }}\n/>\n```\n\nThis will style headings and links with your primary color.\n\nWould you like me to update your startup page with these improved prose styles?"

                    "text": "Great question about the structure in the `Ping.tsx` component! Let's analyze why the nested divs with absolute and relative positioning are used instead of just a single div.\n\nHere's the current structure:\n\n```jsx\n<div className=\"relative\">\n    <div className=\"absolute -left-4 top-1\">\n        <span className=\"flex size-[11px]\">\n            <span className=\"absolute inline-flex h-full w-full animate-ping rounded-full bg-primary-default opacity-75\"></span>\n            <span className=\"relative inline-flex h-full w-full rounded-full bg-primary-default\"></span>\n        </span>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Why This Structure Is Used\n\n### 1. Positioning the Ping Animation\n\nThe main reason for this structure is to position the ping animation **outside** of its parent container without affecting the layout of surrounding elements. Let me break it down:\n\n- The outermost `div` with `relative` creates a positioning context\n- The second `div` with `absolute -left-4 top-1` positions the ping animation 4 units to the left and 1 unit from the top of its parent\n- This allows the ping animation to appear outside the boundaries of its parent element\n\n### 2. Creating the Ping Effect\n\nThe ping effect itself requires two overlapping elements:\n- One that animates (grows and fades)\n- One that stays static (the solid dot in the center)\n\nThis is why there are two `span` elements inside the size container.\n\n## Why Not Just Use a Single Div?\n\nIf we tried to simplify this to a single div with all the spans inside:\n\n```jsx\n<div>\n    <span className=\"flex size-[11px]\">\n        <span className=\"absolute inline-flex h-full w-full animate-ping rounded-full bg-primary-default opacity-75\"></span>\n        <span className=\"relative inline-flex h-full w-full rounded-full bg-primary-default\"></span>\n    </span>\n</div>\n```\n\nWe would face these problems:\n\n1. **No Positioning Context**: Without the `relative` on the outer div, the absolute positioning inside wouldn't have a proper reference point\n\n2. **No Offset Positioning**: Without the middle div with `absolute -left-4 top-1`, we couldn't position the ping indicator outside its parent container\n\n3. **Layout Impact**: The ping animation would affect the layout of surrounding elements instead of being \"removed from the flow\" of the document\n\n## Real-World Use Case\n\nThis component is designed to be placed next to other elements (like text or icons) to indicate activity or notifications. For example:\n\n```jsx\n<div className=\"flex items-center\">\n    <Ping />\n    <span className=\"ml-2\">New messages</span>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe nested structure ensures the ping dot appears slightly to the left of the container without pushing other elements away.\n\n## Could It Be Simplified?\n\nYes, we could potentially simplify it slightly:\n\n```jsx\n<div className=\"relative\">\n    <span className=\"absolute -left-4 top-1 flex size-[11px]\">\n        <span className=\"absolute inline-flex h-full w-full animate-ping rounded-full bg-primary-default opacity-75\"></span>\n        <span className=\"relative inline-flex h-full w-full rounded-full bg-primary-default\"></span>\n    </span>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis removes one div by combining the second div with the first span. However, the original structure might be more maintainable and clearer about its intent.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe nested structure with absolute and relative positioning is used to:\n1. Position the ping animation outside its parent container\n2. Prevent the ping from affecting the layout of surrounding elements\n3. Create the layered effect needed for the ping animation\n\nThis approach gives you more flexibility in placing the ping indicator exactly where you want it relative to other elements."

Let me explain what's happening and answer your questions:\n\n## Explanation of Your Questions\n\n### 1. How Does It Know What `views` Is?\n\nThe line `const {views:totalviews} = await client...` is using JavaScript object destructuring with renaming. It expects the query result to have a `views` property, which it then renames to `totalviews` for use in your component.\n\nThe query should be returning an object that includes a `views` property. Based on your code, it seems like `STARTUP_VIEW_BY_ID` should be a query that fetches just the views count for a specific startup.\n\n### 2. Why `withConfig({useCdn:false})`?\n\nThe `withConfig({useCdn:false})` method is modifying the Sanity client configuration for this specific query. Here's what it does:\n\n- **useCdn:false**: This tells Sanity to bypass its Content Delivery Network (CDN) and fetch the data directly from the main dataset. This is important when:\n  1. You need the most up-to-date data (CDN might have cached older data)\n  2. You're working with data that changes frequently (like view counts)\n  3. You're in a server component that needs fresh data\n\n### 3. Why Haven't We Used This Elsewhere?\n\nYou haven't used `withConfig({useCdn:false})` elsewhere because:\n\n1. **Different Data Requirements**: Other queries might not need real-time data as much as view counts do\n2. **Performance Trade-offs**: Using the CDN is faster but might return slightly outdated data\n3. **Default Configuration**: Your default client configuration might be sufficient for most queries\n\n## The Missing Query\n\nIt seems that `STARTUP_VIEW_BY_ID` is missing from your queries.ts file. Here's what it should probably look like:\n\n```typescript\nexport const STARTUP_VIEW_BY_ID = defineQuery(`*[_type=='startup' && _id==$id][0]{\n  views\n}`)\n```\n\nThis query would fetch only the views field for a specific startup, which is exactly what your View component needs.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nI recommend adding the missing query to your queries.ts file:"

For view counts, which might change frequently, bypassing the CDN ensures you always get the latest count."
